This project includes two files. index.php and form.php, these two files are a brief overview of what we have covered in the class so far. This includes PHP functions like date/time. It also utilizes GET and POST server requests. form.php handles errors and submission of a form all in one file. First, Last and email address fields are required. The form automatically gives an error if these are not filled out. The form also has the ability to show previous data should a user choose to refresh the page. The form is also secure from HTML/JS injection by escaping special characters and removing extra whitespace.
